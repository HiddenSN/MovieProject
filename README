# Movie Project

This is a Udacity's Project wirrten by **Nan Song** to store a list of my favorite movies. The code will generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse my movies and watch the trailers.

# To get started

  - Make sure you have entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py in the same directory.
  - Then double click entertainment_center.py to run the code. (Make sure you install python 2.7 on your computer Or if you can see fresh_tomatoes.html, just double click it and your will see the same result)
  - After you run the code, you should see a website with some movie's image, just click the image to play the trailer.
